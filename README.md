# Electronic Music Tools

Creative Computing projects focussed on Sound Design & Sound Synthesis: design new algorithmic patterns to generate both rhythmic (Drum Machines) and melodic music samples, code new interactive synthesizers and theremins and on top of it, build user-friendly and beautiful UIs to make the music tools available outside music environments and DAWs (web and Mobile).

      - Algorithms for Sound Synthesis and Design 
      - Sound Synthesis
      - Web Audio API (synthesis graphs, User Input,...)
      - Oscillator Parameters & Modulation
      - Triggerable Envelopes
      - ...

### Portfolio 

- 1. Sound Synthesis:
      \* sound synthesis graphs and unit generators  
      \* implement basic synthesis graphs using web audio API  
      \* work with amplitude, pitch and timbre  
      \* respond to user input  

      \* Wiring an oscillator to the audio output  
      \* Setting oscillator parameters from code  
      \* Using oscillators to modulate other oscillators  
      \* Shaping amplitude using a triggerable envelope  
      \* Taking user input from the keyboard and mouse
