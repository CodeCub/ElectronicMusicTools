# Electronic Music Tools

Creative Computing projects focussed on Sound Design & Sound Synthesis: design new algorithmic patterns to generate both rhythmic (Drum Machines) and melodic music samples, code new interactive synthesizers and theremins and on top of it, build user-friendly and beautiful UIs to make the music tools available outside music environments and DAWs (web and mobile).

      - Algorithms for Sound Synthesis and Design 
      - Sound Synthesis
      - Web Audio API (synthesis graphs, User Input,...)
      - Oscillator Parameters & Modulation
      - Triggerable Envelopes
      - ...


## Environments & Languages


### Domain Specific Languages

- __ChucK__: audio programming language for real-time synthesis, composition, and performance. It is designed to favor readability and flexibility for the programmer over other considerations such as raw performance.

- __Csound__: audio DSL, written in C, based on the earlier system called Music 11.

- __Max/MSP__: visual programming language for music and multimedia. It has been used by composers, performers, software designers, researchers, and artists to create recordings, performances, and installations.

- __MUSIC-N Languages__: have very similar model behind them to the analogue synthesis model, where unit generators (modules) would be wired together effectively and programmatically into synthesis graphs, which generates sound.

- __Pure Data (Pd)__: visual programming language for creating interactive computer music and multimedia works.  


### Front-ends, IDEs and music composition environments

- __CodeCircle__ (Goldsmiths University): browser based software development environment developed by Goldsmiths University, as well as a social environment to collaborate with other coders and musicians.
